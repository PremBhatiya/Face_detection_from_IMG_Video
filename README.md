# Face_detection_from_IMG_Video
Face Detection with Python and OpenCV
This Python program uses OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to detect faces in both images and videos.

Prerequisites
Before running this program, make sure you have installed the following libraries:

OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
NumPy (pip install numpy)
How to Use
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where you have saved the repository.

Run the program using the following command:

Copy code
python face_detection.py
The program will prompt you to choose whether you want to detect faces in an image or a video.

If you choose to detect faces in an image, you will be prompted to enter the path to the image file. The program will then display the image with bounding boxes around the detected faces.

If you choose to detect faces in a video, the program will open your computer's default camera and start capturing frames. The program will display each frame with bounding boxes around the detected faces in real time. To exit the video detection mode, press the q key on your keyboard.

How It Works
The program uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in both images and videos. The Haar Cascade classifier is a machine learning-based approach that detects objects in images or video by analyzing the variations in pixel intensities. The classifier is trained on a set of positive and negative images to learn the features that are common to the object being detected.

To detect faces in an image or video, the program first converts the image to grayscale and then applies the face detection algorithm to the grayscale image. The program then draws bounding boxes around the detected faces and displays the result.
